        <h1>WorldWideWeb</h1>
        <h2>1990 </h2>
        <p>
            The WorldWideWeb (not to be confused with the World Wide Web) was the first browser ever created by W3C
            Director Tim Berners-Lee, then renamed Nexus to differentiate from the actual World Wide Web. Unlike today,
            this was the only browser and the only way to access the web.
        </p>
        <h1>Lynx</h1>
        <h2>1992</h2>
        <p>
            Lynx was a texted-based browser that couldn’t display any graphic content.
        </p>
        <h1>Mosaic</h1>
        <h2>1993</h2>
        <p>
            Mosaic was the first browser to allow images embedded in text making it “the world’s first most popular
            browser”.
        </p>
        <h1>Netscape Navigator</h1>
        <h2>1994</h2>
        <p>
            A noticeable improvement to Mosaic came Netscape Navigator.
        </p>
        <h1>Lynx </h1>
        <h2>1992</h2>
        <p>
            Lynx was a texted-based browser that couldn’t display any graphic content.
        </p>
        <h1>Internet Explorer</h1>
        <h2>1995</h2>
        <p>
            Internet Explorer made its debut as Microsoft’s first web browser.
        </p>
        <h1>Opera</h1>
        <h2>1996</h2>
        <p>
            Opera started as a research project in 1994 that finally went public two years later. This was also arguably
            the beginning of the browser wars, mainly between IE 3 and Navigator 3 as Internet Explorer inched ahead
            with new capabilities.
        </p>
        <h1>Safari</h1>
        <h2>2003</h2>
        <p>
            Apple’s Safari browser was released specifically for Macintosh computers instead of Navigator.
        </p>
        <h1>Firefox</h1>
        <h2>2004</h2>
        <p>
            Mozilla launched Firefox as Netscape Navigator faded out.
        </p>
        <h1>Google Chrome</h1>
        <h2>2008</h2>
        <p>
            Google Chrome appeared to soon take over the browser market.
        </p>
        <h1>Microsoft Edge</h1>
        <h2>2015</h2>
        <p>
            Microsoft Edge was born to combat Google.
